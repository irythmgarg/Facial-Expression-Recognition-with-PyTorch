# Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-PyTorch

Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they are well-suited for image tasks.
Typical architecture components:
Convolutional layers: Extract spatial features from images.
Pooling layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
Fully connected layers: Map extracted features to emotion classes.
Activation functions: Use non-linear activations like ReLU for feature learning.
Softmax output layer: Provides probabilities for each emotion class.
Popular pre-trained architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet) can be fine-tuned for FER.

3. Training Process
Loss Function:
Use Cross-Entropy Loss for multi-class classification.
Optimizer:
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess performance.
Training Strategy:
Train the model over multiple epochs.
Use a validation set to monitor overfitting.
4. Inference
During inference, the trained model predicts the emotion label for unseen facial images. The output is typically the class with the highest probability.
